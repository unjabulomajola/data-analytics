# Data Jobs Dashboard — Power BI Case Study


## Introduction

The Data Jobs Dashboard was created to help job seekers, career changers, and business stakeholders better understand the evolving data-job landscape in 2024.
Information about salaries, hiring demand, and skill trends is often fragmented across platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor.
This project consolidates those insights into a single, interactive Power BI dashboard that makes the job market transparent, measurable, and actionable.

The dataset comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search/data),  real-world job postings throughout 2024, includes detailed information on job titles, salaries, company locations, and key skills in demand.
The analysis focuses on uncovering how data roles performed in 2024, highlighting salary trends, demand fluctuations, and skill evolution across quarters,  insights critical for both job seekers and recruitment teams.

The first iteration served as a **high-level market overview**.
It provided an interactive interface for exploring job counts, median salaries, and job-title distributions while tracking hiring behavior over time.
Users could filter by role or drill down to a specific job title, enabling personalized insight into their target position.

Key KPIs and visuals included:
- **Job Count & Trends**: Total 479K openings tracked across 2024, revealing clear quarterly cycles, notably strong hiring in Q1 and Q3 aligned with fiscal planning periods.  
- **Median Salary**: $113K annually (≈ $48 hourly), showing healthy compensation consistency across the year despite fluctuations in demand.  
- **Job Counts by Title**: Data Engineer (≈ 129K) and Data Analyst (≈ 113K) led the market, with Data Scientists (≈ 98K) close behind.  
- **Hourly vs Median Salary Analysis**: Senior and engineering-focused roles continued to command the highest premiums.  
- Users could then **drill through** to specific roles for additional context.
