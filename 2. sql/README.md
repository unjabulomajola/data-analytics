# ðŸ§  SQL Lab

A focused collection of **SQL case studies**, each one designed to extract real insights from real data.  
Every project is a self-contained narrative of problem, logic, and discovery.

**What youâ€™ll find**
- Clean, reproducible SQL queries and datasets  
- Practical business insights driven by relational data  
- Step-by-step query documentation and clear outcomes  
- Ready-to-reference scripts for your own analysis  

**How to explore**
Open any project folder â†’ start with its `README.md` for background and key insights â†’ then open the SQL scripts (`/sql/*.sql`) to dive into the logic.  


**Scope**  
SQL only â€” PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite variations welcome.  
Each project demonstrates real-world query structure, joins, and analytical reasoning that can be applied directly in professional workflows.
