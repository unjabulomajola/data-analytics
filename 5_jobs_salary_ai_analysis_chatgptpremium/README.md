**Business insights**
- Central tendency: the **median salary** is **$124,000**, with an IQR (25th–75th percentile) of $90,000–$160,018 ($70,018 spread). The mean is $129,452, slightly above the median, reflecting a right-skewed distribution.
- Upper tail: the 90th percentile is $195,500. Values extend above $300k but occur infrequently, consistent with senior or niche roles.
- Practical guidance: for benchmarking and offer planning, use the median and IQR rather than the mean to avoid over-weighting outliers; segment medians by title and location for decision-ready ranges.

**Recommendations:**  
Compensation signals cluster around $124k with a moderate upper tail, but sparse disclosure limits precision. Anchor planning and negotiations on median/IQR ranges, and complement with title- and location-specific cuts to turn this indicative distribution into actionable targets. 

### 2. Missing Salary Data:
![](assets/7.png)

**Business insights**
- Salary disclosure is low overall: only 2.68% of postings include an annual salary. Any compensation benchmarking must be presented as indicative rather than comprehensive.
- The United States discloses more frequently than most large markets at 6.76%, while several countries with meaningful volumes show disclosure below 2% (e.g., India 1.01%, Egypt 1.57%, Indonesia 1.25%).
- Within higher-disclosure segments that meet minimum volume (≥500 postings), Puerto Rico (10.38%) and Guam (4.17%) stand out. These pockets can support more precise salary analytics relative to other markets.

**Recommendations:**  
Prioritize the United States and other higher-disclosure segments for data-driven salary guidance, while treating low-disclosure markets as directional only.

## Conclusion  
The 2025 data-roles market is concentrated, cloud-first and execution oriented. Here are the key insights found in this analysis:  
- Demand is concentrated in a small set of countries and a few job platforms. Managing those channels well—and deduplicating syndicated posts—covers most of the market without wasted effort.
- Hiring centers on three role families: data analysis, data engineering, and data science. Senior and ML roles are smaller but high-value and should be targeted deliberately.
- The skills stack is clear: Python and SQL at the core, cloud data platforms for production, and BI/visualization for decision delivery.
- Salary data is inconsistently disclosed. Compensation planning should rely on medians and interquartile ranges, calibrated by title and location rather than raw averages.

## Recommendations and Next Steps  
- Focus sourcing on a short list of platforms and high signal countries, enforce deduplication at ingest and monitor source quality continuously.

- Route candidates by skill signals, engineers toward Python/SQL and cloud tooling, analysts toward BI plus SQL and data scientists toward Python with modeling depth.

- Publish role and location specific compensation guardrails using medians and IQRs, refresh on a regular cadence.

- Stand up lightweight governance: weekly channel metrics, duplicate-rate tracking, and periodic normalization of source names to keep analytics clean and actionable.
