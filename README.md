## Project Overview

This project is a multi-phase exploration of the global data-jobs market from real world data,  from sources such as Linkedin, Glassdoor, Upwork, indeed, etc. It was collected from  **January 2023 to June 2025** and my aim is analyzing how skills, salaries, and job demand evolve across time, geography, and role type.  

The project unfolds in five analytical stages, each representing a layer of maturity in the data analysis process — from descriptive dashboards to advanced SQL-driven modeling and AI-assisted insights.
