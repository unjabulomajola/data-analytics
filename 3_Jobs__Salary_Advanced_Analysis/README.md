# Introduction
This project analyses the real-world Data job market using SQL. The objective is to find which skills pay the most, which are most in demand, and which are optimal to learn for a Fully Remote role for a Data Analyst targeting >$100k annual salary. The analysis runs on actual job postings curated by **Luke Barousse** from platforms such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search/data). My aim is providing an evidence-based view of pay and demand. In this analysis, we focus primarily on uncovering insights for individuals interested in becoming a Data Analyst who works remotely and potentially wants to earn a salary above $100k per year.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying Data Analyst jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Chatgpt**: For plotting basic visuals & fine tuning 

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
	job_title_short,
	job_location,
	salary_year_avg,
	company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
	job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
	job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
	AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
	AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY 
	salary_year_avg DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs üíº:
| Company     | Job Title    | Location | Salary ($/year) |
