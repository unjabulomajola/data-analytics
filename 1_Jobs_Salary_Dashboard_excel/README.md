## Introduction

This dashboard was developed to provide an initial exploratory view of global salary trends in data-related careers.  
The goal was to build an interactive, evidence based summary that helps job seekers, analysts, and recruiters understand compensation dynamics across roles, countries, and job types.

The dataset comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search/data) and spans **January 2023 to June 2025**, containing real-world postings from platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. It contains detailed information on job titles, average salaries, company locations, and the essential skills most in demand across data roles.

This first stage focuses on descriptive insights, identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships that would inform deeper analysis in the subsequent EDA and SQL phases.

## Dashboard Summary 
The Excel dashboard visualizes the following key aspects:

- Median salaries by job title  
- Salary distribution by country  
- Breakdown of job schedule types  
- Interactive filters by job title, region, and contract type  

The design process emphasized readability and fast decision-making through well-structured charts, validation rules, and formula-driven automation.

## Business Relevance

This dashboard acts as an exploratory tool for multiple audiences:

- **Job Seekers:** To assess fair market salaries across locations and experience levels.  
- **Recruiters:** To benchmark compensation and identify competitive hiring regions.  
- **Analysts:** To build hypotheses for deeper exploration (skills, industries, and demand).

## Next Step

Findings from this stage laid the groundwork for the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** phase, which examined skill demand, salary variability, and job frequency in more detail.
